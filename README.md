# subscriber cancellation pipeline

Creation of ETL pipeline to manage cancellations of subscribers for any online streaming service.

## Project Overview

Subscription-based web services are everywhere these days. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify; all these services will analyse their data, both in terms of subscribers, and subscriber cancellations. Analysis of cancellations can help ensure that these services can identify problem areas quickly and efficiently. In order to do this, however, the data of cancellation first needs to be extracted from numerous data sources, transformed into an analysis-friendly format and loaded into storage such as a relational database where it can be analysed. As such, the purpose of this project is to demonstrate how the ETL process of this data can be conducted in python and automated with the help of a bash script.
